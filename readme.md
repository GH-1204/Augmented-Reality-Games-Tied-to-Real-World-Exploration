## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds. By blending AR and blockchain, we aim to foster a community-driven gaming experience that promotes outdoor exploration, fitness, and decentralized ownership of in-game rewards. This is the future of immersive gaming with a tangible impact on the real world.

## Key Features

2. **Blockchain-Based Rewards**:
   - Earn ERC-20 tokens for exploring and interacting with AR objects.
   - Rewards are securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.

3. **Anti-Spam Mechanics**:
   - Smart contracts validate each location visit, ensuring rewards are given only once per unique location.

4. **Player Ownership**:
   - Players own their rewards and can trade or transfer them freely.

5. **Scalable and Extensible**:
   - Future-proof design to integrate NFTs, multiplayer challenges, and more AR features.
